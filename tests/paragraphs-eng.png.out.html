<div><p>The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For<br>science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their<br>grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words.</p><p>Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay<br>expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar,<br>pronunciation and more common words.</p><p>If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular<br>than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular<br>than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be<br>Occidental.</p><p>To an English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine<br>told me what Occidental is.</p></div></body>
